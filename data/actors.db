But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.</p><p>When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).</p><h3>Fighter</h3><p>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Your family is no stranger to wealth, power, and privilege. In the glory days of Neverwinter, your parents were the count and countess of Corlinn Hill, a large estate located in the hills northeast of the city. But Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, devastating Neverwinter and erasing Corlinn Hill from the map. Instead of growing up on an estate, you were raised in a small but comfortable town house in Waterdeep. As an adult, you stand to inherit a meaningless title and little else.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Personal Goal: Civilize Phandalin</i></b>. You were meant for more than being a ruler of nothing at all. Rebuilding Corlinn Hill is impractical, thanks to the volcano. But in the last three or four years, hardy settlers have been rebuilding another ruin near the city: the old town of Phandalin, which orcs sacked five centuries ago. Clearly, what Phandalin needs now is a civilizing influence—someone to take the reins and bring law and order. Someone like you.&nbsp;</p><p>You’re not the only one with such ideas. A knight named Sildar Hallwinter recently set out for Phandalin in the company of a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker. They plan to reclaim an ancient mine and restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity. Since your goals align, Hallwinter should be willing to assist you.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Alignment: Lawful Neutral</i></b>. It’s essential to establish law and order, even if it takes an iron fist to do it. The nobility are bound by honor and tradition to protect their people from both external and internal threats to stability. An organized society leaves no room for evil and chaos to take root.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Gaining Levels&nbsp;</h2><p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.&nbsp;</p><p>With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d10 + 2 to your hit point maximum.&nbsp;</p><h3>2nd Level: 300 XP&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Action Surge</i></b>. You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.&nbsp;</p><h3>3rd Level: 900 XP&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Improved Critical</i></b>. Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.&nbsp;</p><h3>4th Level: 2,700 XP&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Ability Score Improvement</i></b>. Your Strength increases to 18, which has the following effects:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Your Strength modifier becomes +4.&nbsp;</li><li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Strength-based attacks, such as your greataxe and javelin, increase by 1.&nbsp;</li><li>Your modifier to Strength saving throws increases by 1.&nbsp;</li><li>Your modifier to Athletics increases by 1.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>5th Level: 6,500 XP&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Extra Attack</i></b>. Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make two attacks, instead of one, as part of taking that action.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Proficiency Bonus</i></b>. Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.&nbsp;</li><li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in increases by 1.&nbsp;</li><li>Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Improving Your Armor&nbsp;</h3><p>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class. The rulebook contains equipment, including armor.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr><section><p><strong>Character Backstory :</strong> </p><p>Your family is no stranger to wealth, power, and privilege.

The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.<br><br>\n\tOrcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god’s eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.<br><br>\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26272041/OHfz6qo0xHu-1gTc-Wo-5g/med.png?1481668533\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t<strong><em>Tribes like Plagues.</em></strong> Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Ranging Scavengers.</em></strong> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes’ villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.<br><br>\n\tWhen an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.<br><br>\n\tOn rare occasions, a tribe’s leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Leadership and Might.</em></strong> Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.<br><br>\n\tStrength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Orc Crossbreeds.</em></strong> Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs’ drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Aggressive</strong>: As a

Individually weak, goblins gather in large—sometimes overwhelming—numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGoblinoids.</em></strong> Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMalicious Glee.</em></strong> Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can’t help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLeaders and Followers.</em></strong> Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe’s survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChallenging Lairs.</em></strong> Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can’t navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tRat Keepers and Wolf Riders.</em></strong> Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWorshipers of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear.

Only when prey comes near does it rear up, its four barbed tentacles unfurling to reveal its hungry, snapping beak.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tPassive Predators.</em></strong> Gricks rarely hunt. Instead, they drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices, climbing up to ledges, or coiling around stalactites to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for other gricks. It targets the nearest prey, grabbing a fallen creature with its tentacles and dragging it off to eat alone.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tRoving Ambushers.</em></strong> Gricks remain in an area until the food supply dwindles, often because sentient creatures become aware of their presence and plot alternate routes around their lairs. When prey is scarce in the Underdark, gricks venture aboveground to hunt in the wilderness, lurking in trees or on cliff-side ledges. A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized alpha around which the others congregate.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSpoils of Slaughter.</em></strong> Over time, grick lairs accumulate the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert guides know to look out for these telltale signs.

Drinking that darkness from the soil, a blight carries out the will of ancient evil and attempts to spread that evil wherever it can.<br><br><strong><em>Roots of the Gulthias Tree.</em></strong> Legends tell of a vampire named Gulthias who worked terrible magic and raised up an abominable tower called Nightfang Spire. Gulthias was undone when a hero plunged a wooden stake through his heart, but as the vampire was destroyed, his blood infused the stake with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils of new growth sprouted from the wood, growing into a sapling infused with the vampire’s evil essence. It is said that a mad druid discovered the sapling, transplanting it to an underground grotto where it could grow. From this Gulthias tree came the seeds from which the first blights were sown.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Conquest.</em></strong> Wherever a tree or plant is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind or power, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads through root and soil to other plants, which perish or transform into blights. As those blights spread, they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, an infestation of blights can turn any land or forest into a place of corruption.<br><br>In forests infested with blights, trees and plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and undergrowth rapidly spread through buildings and overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can disappear in the space of days.<br><br><strong><em>Controlled by Evil.</em></strong> Blights are independent creatures, but most act under a Gulthias tree’s control, often displaying the habits and traits of the life force or spirit that spawned them. By attacking their progenitor’s old foes or seeking out treasures valuable to it, they carry on the legacy of long-lost evil.<br><br><h2>Twig Blight</h2>Twig blights can root in soil, which they do when living prey are scarce. While rooted, they resemble woody shrubs. When it pulls its roots free of the ground to move, a twig blight’s branches twist together to form a humanoid-looking body with a head and limbs.<br><br>Twig blights seek out campsites and watering holes, rooting there to set up ambushes for potential victims coming to drink or rest. Huddled together in groups, twig blights blend in with an area’s natural vegetation or with piles of debris or firewood.<br><br>Given how dry they are, twig blights are particularly susceptible to fire.<br>\n\n<br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>False Appearance</strong>: While the blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a dead shrub.<br>\n\n<br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong>

Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGoblinoids.</em></strong> Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMartial Might.</em></strong> A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.<br><br>\n\tHobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMilitary Legions.</em></strong> Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.<br><br>\n\tAs loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren’t restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStrategic Thinkers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.<br><br>\n\tLegions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBeast Trainers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConquer and Control.</em></strong> Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.<br><br>\n\tHobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don’t take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.<br><br>\n\tHobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLegion of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don’t fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron.<br><br>\n\n<div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26498292/ZD9YoSsb5a4SVoTW61N_1A/med.jpg?1482250480\"></div><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Martial Advantage</strong>: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft. of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Longsword (One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Longsword (Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Longbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target.

Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.<br><br>A beholder’s spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.<br><br><strong><em>Xenophobic Isolationists.</em></strong> Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.<br><br>The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others’ stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/25981067/gFNe0L09lZdJhwcvN-Z7Pw/med.jpg?1480962559\" alt=\"\"><strong><em>Eye Tyrant.</em></strong> Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master’s behalf.<br><br><strong><em>Alien Lairs.</em></strong> Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder’s lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.<br><br>As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder’s lair reflect the creature’s arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including petrified adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.<br><br><h2>Spectator</h2>A spectator is a lesser beholder that is summoned from another plane of existence by a magical ritual, the components of which include four beholder eyestalks that are consumed by the ritual’s magic. Appropriately, a spectator has four eyestalks, two on each side of the wide eye at the center of its four-foot diameter body.<br><br><strong><em>Magical Guardians.</em></strong> A summoned spectator guards a location or a treasure of its summoner’s choice for 101 years, allowing no creature but its summoner to enter the area or access the item, unless the summoner instructed otherwise. If the item is stolen or destroyed before the years have all passed, a summoned spectator vanishes. It otherwise never abandons its post.<br><br><strong><em>Glimmers of Madness.</em></strong> Though it can speak, a spectator communicates primarily by way of telepathy. It is civil while on guard, openly discussing its orders and its summoner. However, even a brief conversation with a spectator is enough to reveal quirks in its personality brought on by its years of isolation. It might invent imaginary enemies, refer to itself in the third person, or try to adopt the voice of its summoner.<br><br>Like any beholder, a spectator views itself as the epitome of its kind, and it has an intense hatred of other spectators. If two spectators encounter one another, they almost always fight to the death.<br><br><strong><em>Freed from Service.</em></strong> When a spectator has fulfilled its service, it is free to do as it pleases. Many take up residence in the places they previously guarded, especially if their summoners have died. With the spectator’s loss of purpose, the flickers of madness it displayed during its servitude flourish.\n\n<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 2 (1d6 - 1) piercing damage.\n\n<br><br><strong>Eye Rays</strong>: The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 feet of it. It can use each ray only once on a turn.<br><br><div><strong>1. Confusion Ray</strong>: The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can’t move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can’t attack, it does nothing on its turn.<br><strong>2. Paralyzing Ray</strong>: The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><strong>3. Fear Ray</strong>: The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><strong>4. Wounding Ray</strong>: The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</div><br><br><strong>Create Food and Water</strong>: The spectator magically creates enough food and water to sustain itself for 24 hours.<br><br><h2>Reactions</h2><strong>Spell Reflection</strong>: If the spectator makes a successful saving throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the spectator can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Locations</h3><ul><li><a

A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDark Servants.</em></strong> Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator’s bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.<br><br>\n\tMost zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can’t be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.<br><br>\n\tA zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHideous Forms.</em></strong> Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMindless Soldiers.</em></strong> Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.<br><br>\n\tA zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won’t retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> A zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Undead Fortitude</strong>: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Locations</h3><ul><li><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjEwZGIyODRlMjIz  style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Old Owl Well</a></li><li><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDgxYTI5OTlkYTM3  style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 ) ;

Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.<br><br>The half elf is a member of the <em>Order of the Gauntlet</em>, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.<br><br>He is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson.

Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town.

More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who’s there and what they’re up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there.

Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDeadly Ferocity.</em></strong> The owlbear’s reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness, and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe’s superior strength as it attacks without provocation.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConsummate Predators.</em></strong> An owlbear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry’s escape routes.<br><br>\n\tAn owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear’s lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.<br><br>\n\tOwlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSavage Companions.</em></strong> Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owlbear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.<br><br>\n\tElven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owlbears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tOwlbear Origins.</em></strong> Scholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owlbears have always existed in the Feywild.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Keen Sight and Smell</strong>: The owlbear has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The owlbear makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its claws.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Beak</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM

He knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and he suspects that someone is hiding out on the eastern side of town—he’s seen “folk in black masks and cloaks” (the cultists) skulking around. However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower (Area 7 of The Ruins of Thundertree) since the last time he was here. He warns the characters of all these threats, and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>If the characters ask about Cragmaw Castle, Reidoth gladly provides directions. He is a member of the <em>Emerald Enclave</em>, a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order while rooting out troublesome threats. The enclave works to restore and preserve the natural order by keeping the elemental forces of the world in check, preventing civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another, and helping others survive the perils of the wilds. The goblins are a threat to the delicate balance.<br><br>If the characters ask Reidoth about Wave Echo Cave, he will not divulge its location but will offer to guide the party there in exchange for a favor: he wants them to chase off the dragon in area 7. If they succeed, Reidoth will honor his part of the agreement but will not accompany the party inside the mine.<br><br>If the characters attack him for any reason, Reidoth transforms into a gray squirrel and scurries out of the cottage through a crack in the wall. He vanishes into the woods, then waits for the hostile characters to leave. His watch post contains nothing of value.<br><br><h4>Joining the Emerald Enclave</h4>If the party helps Reidoth by chasing off Venomfang, the druid privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the <em>Emerald Enclave</em>. He speaks with those who exemplify the ideal of protecting the natural order. If a character agrees, Reidoth gives the individual the title of <em>Springwarden</em>.</section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Good","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Human","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":2,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"Roll 20","class":" 1"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Druidic Plus Any Two Languages"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"med":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"nat":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":"4","override":null,"max":4},"spell2":{"value":"3","override":null,"max":3},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Reidoth the Druid","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/lost-mine-of-phandelver/characters/011_-_Reidoth_the_Druid/token.png","width":1.4,"height":1.4,"mirrorX":false,"scale":1,"rotation":0,"lockRotation":false,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"dimSight":7.1,"brightSight":7.1,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"vision":false,"actorId":"NTk5NDg0YTg3ZWYw","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"tint":null,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":0,"max":0},"bar2":{"value":0,"max":0}}}},"randomImg":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"name":"Spellcasting.","flags":{},"type":"feat","img":"worlds/lost-mine-of-phandelver/characters/011_-_Reidoth_the_Druid/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The druid is a 4th-level spellcaster.

When the undead flameskull discovers trespassers, it blasts the intruders with fiery rays from its eyes and dreadful spells called up from the dark recesses of its memory.<br><br>Dark spellcasters fashion flameskulls from the remains of dead wizards. When the ritual is complete, green flames erupt from the skull to complete its ghastly transformation.<br><br><strong><em>Legacy of Life.</em></strong> A flameskull only dimly recalls its former life. Though it might speak in its old voice and recount key events from its past, it is but an echo of its former self. However, its undead transformation grants it full access to the magic it wielded in life, letting it cast spells while ignoring the material and somatic components it can no longer employ.<br><br><strong><em>Eternally Bound.</em></strong> Intelligent and vigilant, a flameskull serves its creator by protecting a hidden treasure hoard, a secret chamber, or a specific individual. A flameskull carries out the directives given to it when it was created, and it interprets those commands to the letter. A flameskull’s master must craft its instructions with care to ensure that the creature carries out its tasks properly.<br><br><strong><em>Wreathed in Flame.</em></strong> The fire wreathing a flameskull burns continually, giving off bright light that the creature controls.

Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no somatic or material components to cast its spells.

Most wraiths can transform those they have slain into spectral undead servitors. Mormesk chooses not to, preferring to let the dead stay dead.<br>\n\n<p></p><p>A wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form that seeks to quench all life. The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith’s horrifying existence.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tVile Oblivion.</em></strong> When a mortal humanoid lives a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact, it consigns its soul to eternal damnation in the Lower Planes. However, sometimes the soul becomes so suffused with negative energy that it collapses in on itself and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to some horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless wraith—a malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost nothing of the wraith’s former existence is preserved; in this new form, it exists only to annihilate other life.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBereft of Body.</em></strong> A wraith can move through solid creatures and objects as easily as a mortal creature moves through fog.<br><br>\n\tA wraith might retain a few memories of its mortal life as shadowy echoes. However, even the strongest events and emotions become little more than faint impressions, fleeting as half-remembered dreams. A wraith might pause to stare at something that fascinated it in life, or it might curb its wrath in acknowledgment of a past friendship. Such moments come rarely, however, because most wraiths despise what they were as a reminder of what they have become.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Commanders.</em></strong> A wraith can make an undead servant from the spirit of a humanoid creature that has recently suffered a violent death. Such a fragment of woe becomes a specter, spiteful of all that lives.<br><br>\n\tWraiths sometimes rule the legions of the dead, plotting the doom of living creatures. When they emerge from their tombs to do battle, life and hope shrivel before them. Even if a wraith’s armies are forced to retreat, the lands its forces occupied are so blasted and withered that those who live there often starve and die.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> A wraith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n</p><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>: The wraith can move through an object or another creature, but can’t stop there.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Life Drain</strong>: <i>Melee Weapon Attack: </i>+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. If this attack reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies. This reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until the target finishes a long rest.<br><br><p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Roleplaying Mormesk</h4><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Mormesk speaks in grave whispers. When the wraith first rises up from the floor, it says, \"Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!\" If the characters make no attempt to reason with the wraith, it attacks.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">If the characters try to reason with the wraith, it listens to what they have to say, provided they have not harmed it in any way or seized any of its property. The wraith is irrevocably evil, so the only way the characters can stay its spectral hand is to offer it something a former wizard would consider valuable in exchange for their lives. Mormesk values magic items (particularly scrolls), spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. Whatever the gift, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the wraith of its value.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Regardless of what the characters offer it, the wraith won't relinquish the wooden pipe in the scorched chest. It will, however, part with the coins and gems if the characters agree to kill the spectator in the Forge of Spells. (The wraith doesn't explain what a spectator is. It merely points toward area 15.) Once it receives its gift, the wraith allows characters to peruse its books and keep the secret map in one of them (see the \"Treasure\" section).</p><hr>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM

(The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) He is the person <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmE3NGQ0NjZjNTRj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Sildar Hallwinter</a> has been trying to locate since the <em>Lords' Alliance</em> lost contact with the mage two months ago.<br><br>A former member of the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>, Iarno seized an opportunity in Phandalin to line his own pockets. Originally tasked with setting up a constabulary, the mage instead assembled a group of outlaws and local ruffians to secure his own position in town.<br><br>Iarno knew of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzkxY2M3NWNlODA5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>T</a>he Black Spider through his contacts in the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em> and brokered a meeting. The drow promised to share the secrets and wealth of the Forge of Spells with the wizard in exchange for his help and loyalty.<br><br><h3>Social Behavior</h3>Iarno puts on airs of gentility and courteous manners, addressing his ruffians as “my good gentlemen,” and referring to sordid acts such as kidnapping or arson as “that unpleasant little business” or “those unfortunate events.” He refers to the characters as “guests” and expresses regret that he cannot provide suitable entertainment for their visit. Beneath his genteel demeanor, however, Iarno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaw.<br><br><h3>Combat Behavior</h3>If threatened, Iarno uses his <em>staff of defense</em> to cast <em>mage armor</em> on himself. He then casts offensive spells at enemies he can see.&nbsp;Iarno uses the shield power of his staff for added protection.<br><br>If he is reduced to 8 or fewer hit points and has no avenues of escape, Iarno surrenders. He values his life more than anything, and he remains a model prisoner in the hopes that the Black Spider will somehow learn of his predicament and “arrange for his freedom.”<br><br><h3>Captured Behavior</h3>If he is questioned while in captivity, Iarno relates the following information, all of which is true:<br><br><ul><li>The Black Spider is a drow (dark elf).</li></ul><ul><li>The Black Spider sent three bugbears to help Iarno keep the population of Phandalin under control, but the Redbrands have managed without them. The bugbears know the way to Wave Echo Cave, but Iarno does not.</li></ul><ul><li>The Black Spider is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells. Dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver’s Pact used the magical forge to fashion powerful magic items.</li></ul><ul><li>No other members of the Lords’ Alliance know of Iarno’s betrayal.</li></ul>If Iarno is taken into custody, Sildar Hallwinter arranges to have the wizard incarcerated in the townmaster’s hall until he can be safely transported back to Neverwinter. Whether Iarno stands trial for his crimes is beyond the scope of this adventure. The Black Spider is too preoccupied to meddle in the wizard’s fate.<br><br></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Human","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":1,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":200},"source":"Roll 20","class":" 1"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic","dwarvish","elvish"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":"4","override":null,"max":2},"spell2":{"value":"3","override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Glasstaff","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/lost-mine-of-phandelver/characters/002_-_Glasstaff/token.png","width":1,"height":1,"mirrorX":false,"scale":1,"rotation":0,"lockRotation":false,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":30,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"vision":true,"actorId":"OGIyNzIxMjBhMWJh","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"tint":null,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":22,"max":22},"bar2":{"value":12,"max":0}}}},"randomImg":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"name":"Spellcasting.","flags":{},"type":"feat","img":"worlds/lost-mine-of-phandelver/characters/002_-_Glasstaff/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The mage is a 4-level spellcaster.

As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest or temple servant, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Divine Domain</i></b>. You draw magic from a divine domain—a sphere of magical influence—associated with your deity. Your domain lets you have certain spells, such as <i>bless</i> and <i>cure wounds</i>, always prepared.</p><p>Your domain is Life, which is affiliated with many gods of good. Your god, Marthammor Duin, is the dwarf god of wanderers, travelers, and outcasts—those who move among strange lands and foreign peoples.&nbsp;</p><p>Dwarves who honor him wear his holy symbol, a boot overlaid by an upright mace, on a necklace often made of silver and iron.&nbsp;</p><h2>Background&nbsp;</h2><p>Trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn, you traveled to Neverwinter as part of a mercenary company that serves as both army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers, who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you disobeyed an order and followed your conscience. You were suspended from active duty, though you kept your rank and your connection to the mercenaries.

You can channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel one of two magical effects: Turn Undead or Preserve Life. Both effects require you to use an action and present your holy symbol. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Turn Undead</i></b>. When you use Turn Undead, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.&nbsp;</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Preserve Life</i></b>. When you use Preserve Life, choose one or more creatures within 30 feet of you to heal, then distribute up to 10 hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. At 3rd level, you can distribute 15 hit points, at 4th level 20, and at 5th level 25.&nbsp;</p><h3>3rd Level: 900 XP&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Spells</i></b>. You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells.

Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and deceit better than doppelgangers. Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStealing Secrets.</em></strong> A doppelganger’s adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn’t impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature’s surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature’s name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim’s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHedonistic Swindlers.</em></strong> Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim’s riches.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChangelings.</em></strong> Doppelgangers are too lazy or self-interested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother’s species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Ambusher</strong>: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Read Thoughts</strong>: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Locations</h3><ul><li><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MWFkMDRmOWE2NWU0  style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 ) ; color: rgb( 35 , 82 , 124 ) ; outline: 0px\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cragmaw Castle</a>: Area 14 (Vyerith)</li><li><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjA5MTFiZDk2ZWE4  style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Keyed Encounters</a>: Area 18 (Vhalak) and/or 19 (Nundro Rockseeker)</li></ul></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"","type":{"value":"monstrosity","subtype":"Shapechanger","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":3,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":2,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Doppelganger","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/lost-mine-of-phandelver/characters/016_-_Doppelganger/sides/*.png","width":1,"height":1,"mirrorX":false,"scale":1,"rotation":0,"lockRotation":false,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"dimSight":5,"brightSight":5,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"vision":false,"actorId":"YWFlYmYzNjI2YmU4","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"tint":null,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":52,"max":52},"bar2":{"value":14,"max":0}}}},"randomImg":true,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"name":"Shapechanger","flags":{},"type":"feat","img":"worlds/lost-mine-of-phandelver/characters/016_-_Doppelganger/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its natural form.

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\n<p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time?

They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.<br><br>\n\tMany creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.<br><br>\n\tThough their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.<br><br>\n\tTrue dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.<br><br><h3>Dragon Age Categories</h3>\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Category</strong></td><td><strong>Size</strong></td><td><strong>Age Range</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Wyrmling</td><td>Medium</td><td>5 years or less</td></tr><tr><td>Young</td><td>Large</td><td>6-100 years</td></tr><tr><td>Adult</td><td>Huge</td><td>101-800 years</td></tr><tr><td>Ancient</td><td>Gargantuan</td><td>801 years or more</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<h2>Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</h2>\nDragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant.<br><br>\nA young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell’s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon’s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon’s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon’s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Chromatic Dragons</h2>\nThe black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures—including each other.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDriven by Greed.</em></strong> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world’s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have “stolen” it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon’s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCreatures of Ego.</em></strong> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon’s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDangerous Lairs.</em></strong> A dragon’s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.<br><br>\n\tMost chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tQueen of Evil Dragons.</em></strong> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.<br><br>\n\tTiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her—black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.<br><br>\n\tTiamat’s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen’s power.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Green Dragon</h2>\nThe most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.<br><br>\n\tA green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.<br><br>\n\tA wyrmling green dragon’s thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.<br><br>\n\tA green dragon’s legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCapricious Hunters.</em></strong> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.<br><br>\n\tGreen dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.<br><br>\n\tA green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures’ activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tManipulative Schemers.</em></strong> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.<br><br>\n\tWhen manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConflict and Corruption.</em></strong> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch—sometimes for decades—for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.<br><br>\n\tGreen dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions’ minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions’ tortured dreams.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLiving Treasures.</em></strong> A green dragon’s favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.<br><br>\n<h2>A Green Dragon’s Lair</h2>\nThe forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon’s wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature’s poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.<br><br>\n\tAt the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.<br><br>\n<h3>Lair Actions</h3>\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul><li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li><li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall’s space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it’s in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li><li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li></ul>\n<br>\n<h3>Regional Effects</h3>\nThe region containing a legendary green dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul><li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it’s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</li><li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon’s path.</li><li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair serve as the dragon’s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li></ul>\n<br>\nIf the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26295522/o3YDu_nlrFh2mczHKP2mdg/med.jpg?1481739622\"></div><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The dragon can breathe air and water.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 30-foot cone.

They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.&nbsp;</p><p>Elves can live over 700 years. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance, and they trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence.</p><p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals, which they have no interest in mining.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Forgotten Realms, your people are named sun elves. Also called gold elves or sunrise elves, sun elves have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond, and their eyes are golden, silver, or black. They are more reclusive than the other branch of high elves, the moon elves, but Oghma has called you to live among other peoples, rather than in the sanctuaries of your kin.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, sometime after the hundredth birthday. Before this period, they are called by child names. On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name. Every elf also bears a family name, typically a combination of Elvish words. Some elves traveling among other races translate their family names into Common.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\"><b>Child Names: </b>Ara, Bryn, Del, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Syllin, Vall</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\"><b>Male Adult Names:</b> Adran, Berrian, Carric, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Immeral, Paelias, Quarion, Riardon, Soveliss, Theren, Varis</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\"><b>Female Adult Names:</b> Althaea, Bethrynna, Caelynn, Ielenia, Leshanna, Meriele, Naivara, Quillathe, Silaqui, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\"><b>Family Names (Common Translations):</b> Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom)&nbsp;</p><h2>Wizard</h2><p>Wizards are supreme magic-users. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, they cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. The mightiest wizards learn to conjure elementals from other planes of existence, glimpse the future, or turn slain foes into zombies.&nbsp;</p><h2>Background</h2><p>You have spent your life dedicated to Oghma, all-seeing god of knowledge, and spent years learning the lore of the multiverse.</p><p><b><i>Personal Goal: Reconsecrate the Defiled Altar</i></b>.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"sort":250000,"flags":{},"_id":"MGM4MzRmOWQxNjJk","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"name":"Backpack","type":"backpack","img":"icons/containers/bags/pack-simple-leather.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p></p><p>\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\tA backpack can hold one cubic foot or 30 pounds of gear.

He is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelands.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accompany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords' Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to Iarno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:</p><ul style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\"><li>The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the \"<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWE5YjM3ZTAxNjMx  style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Background</a>\" section to the players at this time.)</li><li>Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Spider is.</li><li>Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn't occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle's location. See the \"What the Goblins Know\" sidebar above.)</li></ul><ul style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\"><li>Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.</li></ul><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it's the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they'll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.</p>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Locations</h3><ul><li><a

A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can’t feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them. Though they gain no nourishment from the corpses they devour, ghouls are driven by an unending hunger that compels them to consume. A ghoul’s undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAbyssal Origins.</em></strong> Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus. Turning against his own people, he feasted on humanoid flesh to honor the Demon Prince of Undeath. As a reward for his service, Orcus transformed Doresain into the first ghoul. Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord’s other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls’ paralytic touch.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGhasts.</em></strong> Orcus sometimes infuses a ghoul with a stronger dose of abyssal energy, making a ghast. Whereas ghouls are little more than savage beasts, a ghast is cunning and can inspire a pack of ghouls to follow its commands.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.

They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAnimated Dead.</em></strong> Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.<br><br>\n\tWhile most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tObedient Servants.</em></strong> Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can’t read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.<br><br>\n\tA skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.<br><br>\n\tAlthough they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren’t mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn’t work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHabitual Behaviors.</em></strong> Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master’s control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can’t eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.<br><br>\n\tWhen skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> A skeleton doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Shortsword</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Shortbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.\n<hr><section

But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.</p><p>When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.</p><p>Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.</p><p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).</p><h2>Fighter</h2><p>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat.</p><p>And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, carrying you in your infancy. Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as servants or laborers where they could.</p><p>You’ve spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a porter and laborer at the city’s bustling docks. But it’s clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you’ll come into your own. You’ll be a hero.</p><p><b><i>Personal Goal: Drive Off the Dragon</i></b>. The ruins of Thundertree call to you. Your family and their friends once lived in prosperity there, and now they’re reduced to menial labor. The ruins are haunted by ash zombies, and rumor has it a dragon has made its lair in the Old Tower, but those are problems a hero can solve. Slay the dragon, or drive it off, and you’ll prove—to yourself and everyone else—you’re a real hero, destined for greatness.</p><p><b><i>Alignment: Lawful Good</i></b>. A hero stands up to evil and never lets bullies have their way. A hero fights for law and order, so that everyone can live in prosperity and happiness. A hero slays monsters, clears ruins, and protects the innocent. You strive to be such a hero.</p><h2>Gaining Levels</h2><p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.</p><p>With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d10 + 2 to your hit point maximum.</p><h3>2nd Level: 300 XP</h3><p><b><i>Action Surge</i></b>. You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>3rd Level: 900 XP</h3><p><b><i>Improved Critical</i></b>. Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><h3>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h3><p>Ability Score Improvement. Your Dexterity increases to 18, which has the following effects:</p><ul><li>Your Dexterity modifier becomes +4.</li><li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Dexterity-based attacks, such as your longbow, increase by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity saving throws increases by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity-based skills increases by 1.</li><li>While you wear light or no armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.</li><li>Your initiative increases by 1.</li></ul><h3>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h3><p><b><i>Extra Attack</i></b>. Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make two attacks, instead of one, as part of taking that action.</p><p><b><i>Proficiency Bonus</i></b>. Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:</p><ul><li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.</li><li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a ) increases by 1.</li><li>Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.</li></ul><h3>Improving Your Armor</h3><p>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class.

They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Furious Tempers.</em></strong> Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre’s wrath in an instant—as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Gruesome Gluttons.</em></strong> Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre?has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry’s skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Greedy Collectors.</em></strong> An ogre’s eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous “treasure” taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre’s trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Legendary Stupidity.</em></strong> Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don’t understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words—and then being eaten in turn.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Primitive Wanderers.</em></strong> Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.<br><br>\n\tAn ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Ogre Gangs.</em></strong> Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.<br><br>\n\tWhenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants’ complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Greatclub</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em>

Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.<br><br><strong><em>Goblinoids.</em></strong> Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.<br><br><strong><em>Followers of Hruggek.</em></strong> Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek’s side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.<br><br><strong><em>Venal Ambushers.</em></strong> Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Brute</strong>: A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the bugbear hits with it (included in the attack).<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the bugbear surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Morningstar</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin

That should have been our first clue.”</em><br>\n—from the journal of Jaster Hollowquill, on his first exploration of Undermountain</blockquote><br>\n\n<div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26271577/KSLrFwhEidkxwaWpzSUggw/med.png?1481667265\"></div><h2>Oozes</h2>\n\nOozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze’s presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch.<br><br>\n\tOozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Slow Death.</em></strong> An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim’s comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.<br><br>\n\tSince not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Unwitting Servants.</em></strong> Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze’s need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Spawn of Juiblex.</em></strong> According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Ooze Nature.</em></strong> An ooze doesn’t require sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Ochre Jelly</h2>\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/27611725/82HXFOCy0uQ1iu5IuCTHmg/med.png?1484858501\">Ochre jellies are yellowish blobs that can slide under doors and through narrow cracks in pursuit of creatures to devour. They have enough bestial cunning to avoid large groups of enemies.<br><br>\n\tAn ochre jelly follows at a safe distance as it pursues its meal. Its digestive enzymes dissolve flesh quickly but have no effect on other substances such as bone, wood, and metal.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Amorphous</strong>: The jelly can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The jelly can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Pseudopod</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Reactions</h2>\n\n<strong>Split</strong>: When a jelly that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new jellies if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new jelly has hit points equal to half the original jelly's, rounded down. New jellies are one size smaller than the original jelly.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Locations</h3><ul><li><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry

Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an old dirt road.&nbsp;</p><p>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.&nbsp;</p><p>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship, as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">Male Names: Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">Female Names: Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">Family Names: Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough&nbsp;</p><h2>Rogue&nbsp;</h2><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem.&nbsp;</p><h2>Background</h2><p>The town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of an older settlement, vacant for five centuries until some hardy settlers set about rebuilding it some years back. Drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the nearby foothills, you came to Phandalin as well, not to earn a living, but to prey on those who struck it rich. You joined a gang calling itself the Redbrands and made some decent coin as a burglar, enforcer, or fence. But you must have made an enemy among your fellow Redbrands.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone set you up. On that person’s word, the head of the Redbrands—a wizard called Glasstaff—tried to have you killed. You escaped, barely alive and thanking Tymora, the goddess of good fortune, for your luck. You fled Phandalin, almost penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Personal Goal: Get Your Revenge</i></b>. Someone in the Redbrands nearly got you killed, and you sure would like to know who it was. And then you’d like to take your revenge—on that person, on Glasstaff, maybe on all the Redbrands. And you just got a tip that might help you: someone named Halia Thornton also has it out for the Redbrands. She lives in Phandalin, which means showing your face to the Redbrands who still want you dead.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Alignment: Neutral</i></b>. You tend to do whatever seems best at the time. Sure, you’ve done some things you’re not proud of, and you’re not personally committed to making the world a better place. But you have no interest in causing suffering or making things worse than they already are.&nbsp;</p><h2>Gaining Levels</h2><p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.</p><p>With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 1 to your hit point maximum.&nbsp;</p><h3>2nd Level: 300 XP&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Cunning Action</i></b>. Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly, so you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.&nbsp;</p><h3>3rd Level: 900 XP&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Second-Story Work</i></b>. You gain the ability to climb faster than normal, so climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Fast Hands</i></b>. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, take the Use an Object action, or use your thieves’ tools to try to disarm a trap or open a lock.</p><p><b><i>Sneak Attack</i></b>. You deal 2d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 1d6.&nbsp;</p><h3>4th Level: 2,700 XP&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Ability Score Improvement</i></b>. Your Dexterity increases to 18, which has the following effects:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Your Dexterity modifier becomes +4.&nbsp;</li><li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Dexterity-based attacks, such as your shortsword and shortbow, increase by 1.&nbsp;</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity saving throws increases by 1.&nbsp;</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity-based skills increases by 1.&nbsp;</li><li>While you wear light or no armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.&nbsp;</li><li>Your initiative increases by 1.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>5th Level: 6,500 XP&nbsp;</h3><p><b><i>Proficiency Bonus</i></b>. Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.&nbsp;</li><li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a ) increases by 1. Your Expertise feature means your bonus for Stealth and the use of thieves’ tools instead each increase by 2.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><i>Sneak Attack</i></b>. You deal 3d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 2d6.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Uncanny Dodge</i></b>. When an attacker you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.&nbsp;</p><h3>Improving Your Armor&nbsp;</h3><p>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class. The rulebook contains equipment, including armor.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr><section><p><strong>Character Backstory :</strong> </p><p>The town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of an older settlement, vacant for five centuries until some hardy settlers set about rebuilding it some years back.

A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Servants.</em></strong>&nbsp;Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator’s bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.<br><br>Most zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can’t be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.<br><br>A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.<br><br><strong><em>Hideous Forms.</em></strong>&nbsp;Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.<br><br><strong><em>Mindless Soldiers.</em></strong>&nbsp;Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.<br><br>A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won’t retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.<br><br><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong>&nbsp;A zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><h2 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Traits</h2><strong>Undead Fortitude</strong>: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit.

Originally tasked with setting up a constabulary, the mage instead assembled a group of outlaws and local ruffians to secure his own position in town.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Iarno knew of the Black Spider through his contacts in the Lords' Alliance and brokered a meeting. The drow promised to share the secrets and wealth of the Forge of Spells with the wizard in exchange for his help and loyalty.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Iarno puts on airs of gentility and courteous manners, addressing his ruffians as \"my good gentlemen,\" and referring to sordid acts such as kidnapping or arson as \"that unpleasant little business\" or \"those unfortunate events.\" He refers to the characters as \"guests\" and expresses regret that he cannot provide suitable entertainment for their visit. Beneath his genteel demeanor, however, Iarno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaws.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">If threatened, Iarno uses his&nbsp;<i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2M1MTRjMjA1MjI3  style=\"color: rgb( 35 , 82 , 124 ) ; outline: 0px\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>staff of defense</a></i>&nbsp;to cast&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MjYzZDk1ZDBjYjhi  style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i><i>mage armor</i></a>&nbsp;on himself. He then casts offensive spells at enemies he can see. Iarno's stat block contains a list of the spells he has prepared. For descriptions of those spells and their effects, see the spell links to the SRD, or the spell in the character sheet. Iarno uses the&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZjM0MzM0MDNlMjQ5  style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i><i>shield</i></a><i>&nbsp;</i>power of his staff for added protection.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">If he is reduced to 8 or fewer hit points and has no avenues of escape, Iarno surrenders. He values his life more than anything, and he remains a model prisoner in the hopes that the Black Spider will somehow learn of his predicament and \"arrange for his freedom.\"</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">If he is questioned while in captivity, Iarno relates the following information, all of which is true:</p><ul style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\"><li>The Black Spider is a drow (dark elf).</li><li>The Black Spider sent three bugbears to help Iarno keep the population of Phandalin under control, but the Redbrands have managed without them. The bugbears know the way to Wave Echo Cave, but Iarno does not.</li><li>The Black Spider is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells. Dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact used the magical forge to fashion powerful magic items.</li><li>No other members of the Lords' Alliance know of Iarno's betrayal.</li></ul><hr><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Kost is a stout, red-robed figure with sallow skin, a shaved scalp, and a black tattoo on his forehead. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes Kost's tattoo as a necromantic symbol. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check verifies the garb as that usual for Thay, a land far to the east where wizards pattern their flesh with tattoos. The tattoo on the head represents a wizard's school of magic. Kost's school is necromancy.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">If any character attempts to talk to Kost, even by calling out a greeting or answering his questions during combat, he temporarily calls off his zombies. The Red Wizard is not particularly aggressive, and he is willing to strike a deal that advances his interests at the same time it helps the characters.</p><p style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Kost stays tight-lipped about the reason for his presence in the region. He is, however, willing to provide information the party needs if it does a favor for him. If the characters give Kost some indication of what they want, he shares one or both of these requests:</p><ul style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\"><li>He wants the orcs at Wyvern Tor removed, since they have scouted out his camp and seem inclined to cause trouble.</li><li>He wants to ask a question of Agatha the banshee: \"What is the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well?\" Kost won't risk the banshee's anger, but the characters could ask the question for him.
